	<p>"Dota is my youth", said by Burning. Dota affects lifes of many young people in this generation, our thinking and acting patterns, our view of the world, our passion and tons of our valuable time. </p>
	<p>Each character in dota has his/her own unique charming and there is definitely no Nr. 1 hero of any kind in any time, but some heroes did burn our souls and leave a series of legencies, they as well as this memory tied with them will be saved here to remind us of our passionate time. </p>
